# RodneyHeiserman_III
Robot Based on David L. Heiserman's Rodney from "How to Build Your Own Self-Programming Robot"

## What's in a Name?
In 1979, David L Heiserman published a book called ["How to Build Your Own Self-Programming Robot."](https://archive.org/details/howtobuildyourow01heis/page/n3/mode/2up)  In it, he describes Rodney, his robot, and how to build your own.  I had wanted this book for long time and finally got a copy.  Of course, the book is rather dated, but the concepts are still interesting.  This project is about updating the design a bit.  Since at least one person has [already built a "Rodney Jr."](https://camppeavy.com/articles/MachineIntelligence.pdf) I decided to name it Rodney Heiserman III.
If you want to build "real" robots, or if you want to understand what this project is all about, I recommend getting a copy of the book.  Of course, it is long out of print, but readily available on the used book market or on loan from [archive.org.](https://archive.org/details/howtobuildyourow01heis/page/n3/mode/2up)  I bought mine from [Abe books](https://www.abebooks.com/) for about $6.
